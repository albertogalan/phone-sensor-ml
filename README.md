## About

Create a training data model from a specific phone that can categorize human movements, transportation modes and Gesture recognition

It uses data from a specific phone to predict the actions

This is an exercise of co-creation data problem solving, the aim is to share and transmit knowledge between the participants 


## Dataset

time-series data generated by gyroscope and accelerometer sensors:

## Specific requirements

- Accuracy of the model
   - More 85% of accuracy
   - validation dataset 

- Data collection User data from a specific phone
    -
- Basic categorization Motion Sense:
   - Stand up
   - Stand down
   - Walking
   - Stepping up
   - Stepping down
   - Running
   - Ciclying
   - Car
   - Metro
   - Bus

- Basic categorization for gesture recognition:
   -

## Idea of [time spending](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/09/perfect-build-predictive-model-10-minutes/) 

- Descriptive analysis on the data - 50% time
- Data treatment ( missing value and outlier fixing) - 40%
- Data Modelling - 4% time
- Estimation of performance - 6% time
